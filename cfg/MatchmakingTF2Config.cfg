//                         TO GET THIS TO RUN IN GAME, TYPE "exec MatchmakingTF2Config"
//                         This config is made with commands that are allowed in TF2 Matchmaking.
//                         It's designed to help your FPS while running on DX9 (which you are forced to do)
//                        This is designed to be executed in-game. So after you get matched up.
//              Don't forget to double-check your advanced video settings to make sure everything is at low
//                                          Lowering your resolution could also give you better FPS
 
//                                          LAUNCH OPTIONS
//   To pull up launch options, right click the game in your library and click on Properties, then Launch Options
//   Copy and paste all of the following in to the text box: +violence_hblood 0 -lv
